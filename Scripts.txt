--- Intro ---
Hello, this is a course about python
which is a very beginner friendly 
programming language that is quite 
easy to learn.

Despite it not being the best language
for performance it is still used in a
lot of applications such as web development,
software development and some maths.

In the next video we will look at installing
python and a cool code editor. It's quite 
easy.

-- Getting Started --

Welcome back, in this video we will be installing
python and a code editor and going over how to
run code.

To install python go over to
https://www.python.org/downloads/
and press download and then open the installer
and follow the instructions *

The code editor we will use is visual studio code
which you can download on the website [link in description]
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Select your OS and download and install it.

If we open VScode there is a button here that says "extensions"
Click that and go to the search bar.
First we're going to install the python extension.
[open it] and just click install
I recommend installing "save-typing" too as it just saves
a lot of time so you dont have to crtl-s every time you run.

After installing these you can click the settings and go 
to colour themes and install a theme you prefer. I am
using [theme].

After that click the files icon. Click file, open folder
and then create a new folder for you first program. Then
press open.

Now we can create our first program. Create a file called
firstProgram.py and then type print("hello world")

If you installed everything correctly then you should be able
to press the play button in the top right and a console will
show up saying "hello world".

Congratulations. You just made your first program.
